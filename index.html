      <h1>My learnings</h1>
      <p>I found this project to be very challenging, although I have learned a lot from it. The biggest thing I will take away from this project is that I should plan my visualization more carefully before I start making it. Using a bar chart felt like a good way of representing the data for the longest time until I had to use my visualization to do the discovery processes and now I wished I would have done things differently. I do think a bar chart could work if the visualization had more interactivity but it is quite hard to implement (for me). </p>
